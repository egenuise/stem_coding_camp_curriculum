'''
This is a skeleton file where you will write your Morse Code Translator
program. We will be using a Morse Code Library that was constructed by
my team previously, so be sure to include the library. Good luck!
'''

#Here we will import the libraries needed for this project. What libraries should be included?


#Next we need to store a Class variable called MorseCode from the libary, using the value MorseCodeLibary.MorseCode


#Next we need to store a pin number for the buzzer. The buzzer is attached to GPIO pin 23


#Now we need to cleanup the GPIO pins from yesterday's project and setup the pins for today.
#Cleanup GPIO using the .cleanup() method


#Set GPIO mode to BCM


#Establish the buzzer pin as an output


#Next we need to create our translator object using the MorseCode class with the buzzer as a paramter.


#This is the loop where the main code should go. It will run until the program is closed.
while True:
    #First we need input from the user to get the message that will be translated

    
    #Change the message to all upper-case letters for the Translator

    
    #Print the message


    #Call the Speak method of the Translator to have your message encoded
