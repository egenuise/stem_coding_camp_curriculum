# STEM Coding Camp Cirriculum by Evan Genuise
## About
I designed and taught a 2-week Advanced Coding STEM Summer Camp for 15 students (ages 10â€“18) through Coconino Community College and the Flagstaff Chamber of Commerce. I built the curriculum from scratch, covering Python, C/C++, Linux, Raspberry Pi, Arduino, REST APIs, GPIO, communication protocols, circuit design, lab tools, and networking.

My focus was on making advanced technical concepts approachable and engaging for a younger audience while managing the classroom environment. This project gave me hands-on experience in curriculum design, teaching, and breaking down complex systems into clear, practical lessons.
