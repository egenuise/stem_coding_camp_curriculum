Curriculum:
	Main Objectives:
		Pi setup
		Intro to programming
		IDLE on Pi, coding environment
		GPIO Output -> blink an LED
		Morse Code with Python?
		Intro to API
		Explain what URL Means
		Building and hosting a LAN webserver
		Building and hosting a LAN minecraft server
		API -> ISS Tracker
		       Reverse Geocode
		       Twitter?
		
Day 1: Blink an LED with a button, no child left behind,
       just say go, then say ask any questions
	Start with addressing the goal
	What is raspberry pi?
	What is Linux?
	What is a command terminal? (Basic commands)
	What is Python? (Download python)
	Accessing Python through the terminal
	What is a breadboard?
	What is an LED?
	How to set up GPIO
	Syntax tools for blinking an LED -> Documentation References
	Let them loose on figuring it out themselves
		Have a pool of functions with skeleton code for them to fill in the blanks
	Ask at the end what they want to learn tomorrow

Supplementary Time Pool:
	Drone kits -> proprietary and build yourself
	Rocket kits -> paper stomp rockets
	3D Printing -> TinkerCAD
	Kahoot -> As a review of lectured material
	Kahoot -> As a fun break time

Structure:
	State the goal
	Do the lecture
	Lecture kahoot
	Start the project
	Debrief the results

Weekly Schedule Skeleton:
	Introduction to Python stuff
	GPIO stuff
	Morse Code project
	API Day stuff: ISS, Reverse_Geocode
	Web server stuff/Minecraft Server stuff
