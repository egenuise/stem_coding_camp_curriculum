# Gamebook
# This is a skeleton code file to help you with your decision story game

'''
First we want to come up with a story for the user to go through.
Then we will add 6 decisions for the user to make throughout the game.
And we will be printing throughout to give the user the proper story.
'''

# First print any introduction details that you want to have in your code
# This could be the start of your story or anything that you want it to be really




# Now we will begin gathering user input for the decisions that they make
# Print a choice of options the user can make to begin their journey

# Gather user input for their first decision
firstDecision = input("Please choose an option: ")


# check the user's first input
if firstDecision == placeHolder: ### fill in what the comparison should be
    # print what happens to the user for this decision, let's make this a wrong choice

elif firstDecision == placeHolder: ### fill in what the comparison should be
    # let's have this be a successful story outcome
    # print how the story progresses
    
    # give the user a new decision

    # get input for the second user decison
    secondDecision = input("Please make a choice: ")

    # check the input
    if secondDecision == placeHolder: ### fill in what the comparison should be
        # let's game over here again
        # print what happens to the user

    else if secondDecision == placeHolder: ### fill in what the comparison should be
        # let's progress the story here
        #print how it progresses

        # give the user a new decision

        #get input fo the third user decision
        thirdDecision = input("please enter a decision: ")

        #check what the user decides
        if thirdDecision == placeHolder: ### fill in what the comparison should be
            #lets do a game over here
            # tell the user how they lost

        else if thirdDecision == placeHolder: ### fill in what the comparison should be
            # lets make this success again and progress

            # tell the user what happens

            # present a new decison

            # get user input
            fourthDecision = input("Please choose an option: ")

            # check what the user decides
            if fourthDecision == placeHolder: ### fill in what the comparison should be
                # again lets game over here

            else if fourthDecision == placeHolder: ### fill in what the comparison should be
                # this is success
                # tell the user what happens

                # present a final decsion

                # get the user input
                fifthDecision = input("Please choose an option: ")

                # check the decision
                if fifthDecision == placeHolder: ### fill in what the comparison should be
                    # again lets game overr

                else if fifthDecision == placeHolder: ### fill in what the comparison should be
                    # and now lets have the ending to the story

                    # print out the final completion to the game and tell
                    # the user if it is a happy or sad ending
